## The journey
My journey is a blend of two seemingly diverse worlds: music and technology. As a guitar player and musical director, I've had the honor of playing for some of Israel's top singers and performers, gracing stages and creating memorable musical experiences. Music has been my passion and profession for many years, and it continues to inspire me every day.

## From Strings to Servers: My DevOps Journey
A few years ago, I decided to mix between two of my life long passions and I've embarked on a new adventure in the tech world, transitioning from guitar strings to server scripts. Now, I am also a DevOps engineer, passionate about the intersection of development and operations, automating processes, and enhancing efficiency within IT infrastructures. This shift has allowed me to explore my love for technology and problem-solving in new and exciting ways.


## Sharing Knowledge: My Blog
To document my learnings and share insights with others in the tech community, I started a blog focused on my DevOps and IT experiences. Here, I delve into various topics, from practical tutorials and best practices to personal reflections on the evolving landscape of technology. My goal is to create a resource that is both informative and engaging, helping others navigate their own tech journeys.

## Why Music and Tech?
You might wonder how music and technology intertwine in my life. For me, both fields are about creativity, precision, and continuous learning. Whether I’m composing a new melody or configuring a CI/CD pipeline, I approach each task with the same passion and dedication. The skills I've honed as a musician—such as attention to detail, discipline, and the ability to collaborate effectively—have seamlessly transferred into my tech career, enriching my approach to problem-solving and innovation.

Thank you for stopping by! Whether you're here for the music, the tech insights, or a bit of both, I hope you find something that resonates with you. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, collaborate, or just chat about guitars and servers.

Hope you enjoy!!

Gabriel.
